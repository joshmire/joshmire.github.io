		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<br>	
		<div class="about-text">
			<p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website!  Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.</p>
			<p>My name is Joshua Hillborn Mire, but I prefer to go by Josh.  I was born in Houston, Texas, but moved to South Florida at the age of two. For a while I lived with my grandmother who had an Ed.D. in early childhood education.  I credit much of my success to her beginning my formal education at such a young age.</p>
			<p>In middle school I took courses in web development, video production, graphic design, and desktop publishing.  While I enjoyed each, I quickly stood out as an efficient web designer with an eye for aesthetics.  In my eighth-grade year I was appointed web master of my school’s website.  I would go on to be my high school's web master and even worked as a freelance web designer for a bit.  In 2008 I graduated from Park Vista Community High School’s Business Academy having completed their web design and accounting tracks.</p>
			<p>As an undergraduate, I was a member of the Upsilon Phi chapter of the International Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI).  I served as FIJI’s special events chairman and as a pledge educator.  Outside of my fraternity I volunteered as an undergraduate teaching assistant and was an intern with Florida Organic Growers.  In 2013 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in food and resource economics from the University of Florida (UF).  A portion of my coursework was completed abroad in Ireland, France, and the United Kingdom where I studied trade policy and food production.</p>
			<p>While pursuing my bachelor's degree, some college friends and I founded a non-profit, The Aquaponic Research Center (ARC).  Our goal was to build a two-acre aquaponic farm in South Florida where we would research methods of improving the aquaponic farming model.  Our organization also intended to manage several food-based community development projects.  Eventually we decided dissolve our organization to pursue other endeavors.</p>
			<p>In 2015 I returned to school to pursue a master's degree in economics from Florida Atlantic University (FAU).  While at FAU I was elected to the student government’s legislative branch and shortly thereafter named parliamentarian of the House of Representatives.</p>
			<p>Upon graduating I returned to the University of Florida to pursue a Ph.D. in food and resources economics where I also served as a student government representative.  However, after completing a year of coursework it became clear that the opportunity costs were not there and that I’d be better served gaining real-world experience while earning more money than my teaching assistant contract was worth.</p>
			<p>After leaving UF, while looking for work, I began volunteering with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a reservist training specialist.  I assisted in the response to hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.</p>
			<p>In 2018 I began working as a research associate for Nova Southeastern University's (NSU) Office of Institutional Effectiveness.  In addition to my regular duties, I often worked to encourage university stakeholders to adopt modern technologies for data collection and reporting.  In this pursuit, I authored an R package that allowed me to automate the export of many of my metrics reports that also required university branding for external dissemination.</p>
			<p>Since leaving NSU I have continued to work as a data scientist in the field of institutional research.  I am actively involved with the Association for Institutional Research, serving on the Visual Displays of Data committee, and having volunteered the past three years to assist Forum Selection Committee in choosing presentations for the annual forum.</p>
